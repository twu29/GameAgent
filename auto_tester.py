''' auto_tester.py
A simple tester for K-in-a-Row agents. Intended as a debugging aid.

This variation on the old partial autograder was created
on Nov. 7, 2025.

We assume the program being tested here ALREADY CAN PLAY
ALL TYPES OF K-IN-A-ROW GAMES WITH THE Game_Master_Offline.py
program.

Therefore, the tests here will be additional tests for
specific aspects of the agent's capabilities.

 tests:

1. Static eval  (TENTATIVELY worth 10 points)
2. Minimax
  2a. Straight minimax (TENTATIVELY worth 10 points)
  2b. Alpha-beta (TENTATIVELY worth 10 points)

Passing these tests does NOT mean that the agent is
necessarily complying with all assignment requirements
or earning exactly the same number of points for the
tested features.  However, it's a good sign that your
agent is complying with key aspects of the assignment
requirements.

Also, eligibility for the class tournament may be
determined using additional factors, such as what libaries
might be imported, timing behavior, etc.

To use this, change "YourUWNetID_KInARow to your actual agent file's
name, make sure you have the imported files in the same folder.
(These include both the ones your agent imports and the ones imported
by this autograder.)
Then run the command:

python autograder.py
  or on some systems:
python3 autograder.py

def test_static_eval(agent):
    '''A static evaluation function should return high values
    on states that are good for X, and similarly strong but
    negative values on states that are good for O.
    Furthermore values should roughly track HOW good a
    state is for either player, and a state that's equally
    good for X and O should return a value of 0 or close to 0.

    The function should be robust to variations in the game
    type (i.e., initial state) and be able to work OK on
    whatever game states are presented to it, e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe,
    Cassini, etc. 

    Part 1: Tic-Tac-Toe
      State A:  win for O
      State B:  good for O
      State C:  neutral
      State D:  good for X
      State E:  win for X

    Part 2: Cassini

      State G:  good for O
      State H:  neutral
      State I:  good for X
